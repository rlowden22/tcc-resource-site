    <h1>About TCC</h1>
    <p>Tranz Central Coast (TCC) is a grassroots, volunteer-driven organization
       dedicated to creating safe and affirming spaces for transgender, nonbinary, 
       and gender-diverse people. We bring our community together through support groups, 
       social events, and educational outreach while connecting individuals and families
        with inclusive local resources.</p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p class="muted">Our mission is to support, uplift, and celebrate the transgender and gender-diverse community
       of the Central Coast by fostering connection,
       building resilience, and advancing equity through advocacy and education.</p>

    <h2>Who We Serve</h2>
    <p class="muted">TCC serves transgender, nonbinary, and gender-diverse individuals of all ages, as well as their families, friends, and allies. Our reach extends across California’s Central Coast, including San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties, where we work to strengthen visibility, 
      provide affirming support, and build bridges between community members 
      and inclusive local organizations.</p>


<h2>Leadership</h2>
<p class="muted">
  TCC is guided by a volunteer leadership team committed to supporting our community 
  with compassion, inclusivity, and collaboration. Our leaders bring diverse experience 
  and work together to ensure that programs and resources remain accessible and relevant.

    <h3>Committee Chair: Landon St. James (he/him)</h3>
    <p class="muted">Tranz Central Coast Committee Chair</p>
    <p>
      Landon enjoys life on the Central Coast with his beautiful wife, 3 kids, 3 dogs, 1 cat 
      (and a few other barnyard animals). He’s proud to advocate for the queer community, 
      especially our trans youth. Landon loves to build community – relationships,
       resources, safety structures, and has found so much fulfillment serving trans and 
       gender non-conforming people through Tranz Central Coast. He decided to get involved with 
       TCC because so often when meeting other local trans people, they would tell him he 
       was the first trans person (besides themselves) they had met. “We need to find ways 
       to connect with each other!” If you see him around town or at a TCC event please stop him and say hello.
