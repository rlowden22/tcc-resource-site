# tcc-resource-site

This project is a simple website designed to connect trans and gender diverse community members with local resources and other information. Phase one provides a clean, easy-to-navigate list of resources. Phase two will expand the project into a full-stack web application with features such as community submissions, search and category filters, and maps to make resources accessible.
